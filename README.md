This script is broken and no longer works! Don't waste your time using it :)
====================


4od-dl
======

Ruby script to download, convert and tag stuff from 4od.

Supported Platforms
===================

This script has been tested on OS X 10.7 (Lion). I imagine it will work on older versions of OS X and perhaps on Linux too, but I've not tested it. 

It definitely won't run on Windows but other than the hardcoded 'which' calls to find rtmpdump/ffmpeg/AtomicParsley it should probably work. Feel free to have a go and send a pull request :).  

Pre-Requisites
=========

To run, the following 3 binaries must be resolvable via your PATH:

1. rtmpdump: Either [download and compile yourself](http://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu/) or grab the OS X package from [trick77.com](http://trick77.com/2011/07/30/rtmpdump-2-4-binaries-for-os-x-10-7-lion)
2. ffmpeg: Either [download and compile](http://ffmpeg.org/) or grab the OS X binary from [ffmpegmac.net](http://ffmpegmac.net)
3. AtomicParsley: Either download and compile or grab the binary from [atomicparsley.sourceforge.net](http://atomicparsley.sourceforge.net/)

It also uses the following gems that you must install (I will sort out a Gemfile eventually):

* logger
* hpricot
* crypt

Usage
=====

	Usage: 4od-dl [options]
    	-p, --programids ID1,ID2,ID3     Program IDs to download - this is the 7 digit program ID that you find after the hash in the URL (e.g. 3333316)
    	-o, --outdir PATH                Directory to save files to (default = pwd)
	    -r, --remux                      Copy video/audio streams from FLV to MP4 - do not transcode audio
    	-s, --search-range N             Search range to find MP4 versions of a program (default = 10)
	    -v, --version                    Display version information
	    -d, --debug                      Show advanced debugging information
	    -h, --help                       Display help

For instance the ID for the following programme is 3264880: http://www.channel4.com/programmes/grand-designs/4od#3264880


F4M files
=========

4od-dl does not support downloading F4M files as these are an encrypted form of Adobe HTTP Dynamic Streaming (HDS) and I don't know how to download or decrypt them.

A workaround to this was suggested on the issues tracker by richthespoof. It turns out that there are unencrypted MP4 versions of the episode available but under a different episode ID - I think there are for streaming to a PS3 as 4od supports streaming to a number of different devices. If 4od-dl comes across a f4m file it will automatically search surrounding episode IDs to find a MP4 version to download. The search range is currently 10 either side, but feel free to change the value of @search_range if you have problems.

Copying to your iPad
============

I have had trouble copying some downloaded programmes to my iPad - iTunes just refuses to transfer them. I think it is because the AVC level of the downloaded file is too high (some of the downloads are High@4.1). I have tried changing the AVC level using [subler](http://code.google.com/p/subler/) however it still does not work, most likely because the video stream uses features that the iPad does not support.

The only workaround I have so far is to re-encode the file using [handbrake](http://handbrake.fr/) (or similar). See [issue 4](https://github.com/robwatkins/4od-dl/issues/4) for more information.

Changelog
=========

v0.4 (beta) (22 December 2012):

* Added --search-range / -s parameter to control the search range used to find a MP4 version when the prog ID points to a F4M. Default is 10.

v0.3 (15 December 2012):

* Improved error handling - now ignores some non-fatal errors when downloading a program
* Improved algorithm for generating file name
* AtomicParsley now embeds a program thumbnail into the AVI
* Improved handling of programs with incomplete metadata (such as no Episode/Series number)

v0.2 (11 December 2012): 

* Better support of new-style 4od programs by searching for a MP4 version of the program ID given
* Uses new 4odplayer SWF file (v 11.34.1) with rtmpdump

v0.1 (May 2012):

* First version of 4od-dl

To Do
======

This is a pretty rough hack so I'd like to add (in no order):

* Basic text-based PVR functionality to find programmes to download
* More control over the filename
* Use a Gemfile to manage Gem dependencies
* ~~Support downloads of .f4m files~~ **Workaround added December 2012**
* ~~Ability to download to another directory than the one you're running 4od-dl in~~ **Done 14th May**
* ~~Remove the .flv once downloading is complete~~ **Done 14th May**
